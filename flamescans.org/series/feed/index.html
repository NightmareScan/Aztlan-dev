<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“…I&#8217;m going to fuck up that bastard first.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Revenge will be done as thoroughly as possible, and plans will be made without a flaw.</p>
<p>Behold the limitless acts of the God of War of South Korea, Sung Jihan, who will save the future from destruction and attain peace!</p>

<p>In my dream, I was an adult, dressed in clothes I&#8217;d never seen before and wearing a &#8216;mask&#8217;.</p>
<p>&#8216;Now, it&#8217;s time to roll the dice.&#8217;</p>
<p>And so the dream game that began with the roll of the dice, the &#8216;World of Eternity&#8217;, became my destiny and my life, perhaps even my world itself. </p>
<p>As I rolled the dice with mysterious, nameless people, I was happy and joyous. </p>
<p>Until I became a piece on the board myself. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Noh Eun-Ha, the < Undead >.</p>
<p>I had returned from brink of death on the deepest floor of the <Abyssal Dungeon>, a Black Dungeon that was deemed impossible to clear by humanity.</p>
<p>In my previous life, I lived in order to die, and I lived because I couldn&#8217;t die.<br />
I had lost my family, shut off my heart, and wanted to die while burning my hatred towards the monsters.</p>
<p>Even though I had desperately wanted to live, wanted to find a reason to live, I was just afraid of looking back on my life of fulfilling my empty heart by killing something.</p>
<p>It will be different in this life.<br />
I will do anything to be happy. </p>
<p>I will kill in order to live, and I will survive no matter the cost.<br />
Even if I walk a thorny path that no one recognizes alone. </p>
<p>Even power.<br />
No matter who it may be, they will kneel before me.</p>
<p>Even wealth.<br />
No matter who it may be, they will not look down on me.</p>
<p>Even strength.<br />
No matter who it may be, they will not even dare confront me.</p>
<p>Without fail, in this life-<br />
I want to be happy. </p>
